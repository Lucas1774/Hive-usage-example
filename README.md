THIS WAS A COLLEGE PROJECT.

## Program

Imports a couple of .csv files into a noSQL database and makes use of the tools provided by the framework to make queries over it. It accomplishes this in a very convoluted, non-direct way.

## Context

This Jupyter notebook was written in a UNIX virtual machine: the Cloudera environment. It accesses the Hadoop database through Hive: a solution that gives the user the possibility to access his data using a SQL-like syntax. For presentation purposes, it is encapsulated in a Jupyter notebook where batch scripts are written.  
Despite the convoluted process, it was a great, surprisingly manageable window into a lot of tools (unfortunately some of them somewhat irrelevant): virtualization, UNIX, Jupyter Notebooks, Python, Hadoop, Hive and HQL, although it doesn't put the spotlight on the strong points of Big Data environments, in fact, quite the opposite.
